## Rules

- Two teams play the game
- The team to score 44+ first wins
- If your current score is:
  - 5n + 1, then  Person/Place/Animal (Yellow)
  - 5n + 2, then Object (Blue)
  - 5n + 3, then Action (Orange)
  - 5n + 4, then Difficult (Green)
  - 5n, then All Play (Red)
- You can't cross 44 without ending up at 44 precisely. For example, if your score is 43, you have to roll exactly 1 to get to 44 and then cross 44.
